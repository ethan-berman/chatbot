# chatbot
Final Milton programming project

Thanks to:
Github user dsouzarc for SQL commands to help read in imessages
https://github.com/dsouzarc/iMessageAnalyzer/blob/master/Random%20SQLite%20Commands.txt

When this is complete, as long as you have necessary dependencies installed if you are running on a mac it should train off of imessage's chat.db file.


Then you should be able to talk to yourself trained off of your own conversation data, and it will ideally get better at talking to you as you continue to talk.
